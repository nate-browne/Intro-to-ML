    "\n",
    "Many ML problems involve thousands or even millions of features for each training instance. This both makes training *extremely* slow as well as making it much harder to find a good solution. This is known as the *curse of dimensionality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in real-world problems, it's often possible to reduce the number of features considerably, turning an intractable problem into a tractable one. As an example, with the MNIST images, the border pixels are almost always white so they could be dropped from the training set without losing much information. Moreover, neighboring pixels tend to be highly correlated; if you merge them into a single pixel (by doing something like taking the mean of the two pixel intensities) you won't lose much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: As you know, reducing dimensionality will make you lose some information (like compressing a photo to JPEG can degrade quality) so even though training will speed up, it may make the system perform worse as well as making your pipelines more complex (and thus harder to maintain). Therefore, you should try to train the system with the original data before considering using dimensionality reduction if trainnig is too slow. In some cases, however, reducing dimensionality of the training data may filter out some noise and unnecessary details (and thus result in higher performance) but this generally won't happen.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from speeding up training, dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful for data visualization (a.k.a. *DataViz*). Reducing the number of dimensions down to two or three makes it possible to plot a high-dimensional training set on a graph and often gain some important insights by visually detecting patters, such as clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss the curse of dimensionality and get a sense of what goes on in high-dimensional space. Then, we'll present the two main approaches to dimensionality reduction (projection and Manifold Learning) and we'll go through three of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, Kernel PCA, and LLE."

    "## The Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "We're pretty used to life in 3 dimensions (or 4 counting time), so our intuition fails us when we try to imagine a high-dimensional space. Try googling a tesseract to see what I mean. It turns out that many things behave differently in high-dimensional space. A troublesome difference is that if you pick two points randomly in a unit square, the distance between these two points will be, on average, roughly 0.52 units. If you pick two random points in a unit 3D cube, the average distance will be roughly 0.66 units. IF you pick two points randomly on a 1,000,000-dimensional hypercube? The average distance, surprisingly, will be about 408.25 units (roughly $\\sqrt{1,000,000/6}$). It may seem weird that the points are so far apart but yet on the same cube. This does imply though that higher dimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse; most training instances are likely to be far away from each other. Of course, this also means that a new instance will likely be far away from any training instance, making predictions much, *much* less reliable than in lower dimensions since they'll be based on much larger extrapolations. In short, __the more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting it__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, one solution to this would be to increase the size of the training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. In practice, sadly, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. With just 100 features (much less than MNIST, by the way), you'd need more training instances than atoms in the *__observable universe__* in order for training instances to be withing 0.1 units of each other on average (assuming they were spread out uniformly across all dimensions)."

    "Before we dive into the algos, let's take a look at the two main approaches to reducing dimensionality: projection and Manifold Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real-world problems, training instances *aren't* spread out uniformly across all dimensions. Many features are almost constant, whilst others are highly correleated (like in the MNIST dataset). As a result, all training instances actually lie within (or close to) a much lower-dimensional *subspace* of the high-dimensional space. If we project each training instance perpendicularly (or technically, orthogonally) onto this subspace, we get a 2D dataset that corresponds to the 3D one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this isn't always the best approach to dimensionality reduction. IN many cases, the subspace may twist and turn, such as in the famous [*Swiss roll*](https://www.mathworks.com/content/mathworks/www/en/products/demos/machine-learning/swiss_roll/swiss_roll/jcr:content/mainParsys/image_1.adapt.full.high.png/1469940824635.png) dataset. Simply projecting this dataset onto a plane would squash differently layers together. What we'd really like for this dataset would be to \"unroll\" it flat."

    "\n",
    "The Swiss roll is an example of a 2D *manifold*. Put simply, a 2D manifold is a 2D shape that can be bent and twisted in a higher-dimensional space. More generally, a $d$-dimensional manifold is part of an $n$-dimensional space (where $d \\lt n$) that locally resembles a $d$-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of the Swiss roll, $d = 2$ and $n = 3$. It locally resembles a 2D plane that was rolled in the third dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many dimensionality reduction algos work by modeling the *manifold* on which the training instances lie; this is called *Manifold Learning*. It relies on the *manifold assumption* (a.k.a. the *manifold hypothesis*) which holds that most real-world, high-dimensional datasets lie closer to a much lower-dimensional manifold. This assumption is often empirically observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the MNISt dataset, we can see that if we randomly generated images, only a *ridiculously* small amount of them would look like handwritten digits. Since the degrees of freedom available for creating a digit are dramatically lower than the degrees of freedom available if we could generate any image we wanted, the constraints tend to squeeze the dataset into a lower-dimensional manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manifold assumption is often accompanied by another implicit assumption: that the task at hand (classification or regression) will be simpler if expressed in the lower-dimensional space of the manifold. This assumption doesn't always hold though.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Preserving the Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can project the training set onto lower-dimensional hyperplanes, you first need to choose the *correct* hyperplane. It seems reasonable to select the axis that preserves the maximum amount of variance, as it will most likely lose less info than the other projections. Another way to justify this choice is that the axis that minizies the mean squared distance between the original dataset and its projection onto that axis. This is the idea behind [PCA](https://goo.gl/gbNo1D).\n",

It also finds a second axis, orthogonal to the first, that accounts for the largets amount of raining variance. On higher-dimension datasets, PCA contiues this process so that there are as many axes as there are dimensinos in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit vector that defines the i<sup>th</sup> axis is called the i<sup>th</sup> *principle component* (PC).\n",

    "\n",
    "So, how can you find the principal components of a training set? There's a standard matrix factorization technique known as *Singular Value Decomposition* (SVD) that can decompose the training set matrix $\\textbf{X}$ into the dot product of three matricies $\\textbf{U} \\cdot \\Sigma \\cdot \\textbf{V}^T$ where $\\textbf{V}$ contains all the principal components we're looking for.

    "### Selecting a Kernel and Tuning Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "As kPCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm, there is no obvious performance measure to help you select the best kernel and hyperparameter values. However, dimensionality reduction is often a prep step for a supervised learning task (e.g. classification) so you can simply use grid search to select the kernel and hyperparameters that lead to the best performance on that task. For example, the following code creates a two-step pipeline by first reducing dimensionality to two dimensions using kPCA then applying Logistic Regression for classification. Then it uses `GridSearchCV` to find the best kernel and gamma value for kPCA in order to get the best classification accuracy at the end of the pipeline:"

    "Another totally unsupervised approach is to select the kernel and hyperparams that yield the lowest reconstruction error. However, reconstruction isn't as easy as with linear PCA. Thanks to the kernel trick, taking a 3D swiss roll and the resulting 2D dataset with an RBF kernel is mathematically equivalent to mapping the training set to an infinite-dimensional feature-space using the *feature map* $\\varphi$, then projecting the transformed training set down to 2D using linear PCA. Notice that if we could invert the linear PCA step for a given instance in the reduced space, the reconstructed point would lie in feaure space, not the original space. Since the feature space has infinite dimensions, we cannot compute the reconstructed point and therefore cannot compute the true reconstruction error. It's fortunately possible to find a point in the original space that would map close to the reconstructed point. This is called the reconstruction *pre-image*. Once this pre-image is obtained, you can measure its squared distance to the original instance. You can then select the kernel and hyperparams that minimize this reconstruction pre-image error.\n",

    "Here's how it works: first, for each training instance $\\textbf{x}^i$, the algo identifies its $k$ closest neighbors (in the preceding code, $k = 10$), then it tries to reconstruct $\\textbf{x}^i$ as a linear function of these neighbors. More specifically, it finds the weights $w_{i,j}$ such that the squared distance between $\\textbf{x}^i$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^mw_{i,j}\\textbf{x}^j$ is as small as possible, assuming that $w_{i,j} = 0$ if $\\textbf{x}^i$ is not one of the $k$ closest neighbors of $\\textbf{x}^i$. Thus the first step of LLE is the constrained optimization problem described in the next equation where $\\textbf{W}$ is the weight matrix contaning all of the weights $w_{i,j}$. The second constraint simply normalizes the weights for each training instance $\\textbf{x}^i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\textbf{W}} = \\mathop{\\text{argmin}}_\\textbf{W}\\sum_{i=1}^m\\Bigg(\\textbf{x}^i-\\sum_{j=1}^mw_{i,j}\\textbf{x}^j\\Bigg)^2 \\\\ \\text{subject to}\\begin{align*}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}w_{i,j} = 0 &\\text{if $\\textbf{x}^j$ is not one of the $k$ c.n. of $\\textbf{x}^i$} \\\\ \\sum_{j=1}^mw_{i, j} = 1 &\\text{for i = 1,2, $\\cdots$, m}\\end{array}\\right.\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, the weight matrix $\\hat{\\textbf{W}}$ (containing the weights $\\hat{w}_{i, j}$ encodes the local linear relationship between the training instances. Now the second setp is to map the training instaces into $d$-dimensional space (where $d \\lt n$) whilst preserving these local relationships as much as possible. If $\\textbf{z}^i$ is teh image of $\\textbf{x}^i$ in this $d$-dimensional space, then we want the squared distance between $\\textbf{z}^i \\text{ and } \\sum_{j=1}^m\\hat{w}_{i, j}\\textbf{z}^j$ to be as small as possible. This idea leads to the next equation (an unconstrained optimization problem). It's simlar to the first step, but instead of keepign the instances fixed and finding the optimal weights, we're doing the reverse (keeping the weights fixed and finding the optimal position of the instances' images in the low-dimensional space. Note that $\\textbf{Z}$ is the matrix containing all $\\textbf{z}^i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\textbf{Z}} = \\mathop{\\text{argmin}}_\\textbf{Z}\\sum_{i=1}^m\\Bigg(\\textbf{z}^i - \\sum_{j=1}^m\\hat{w}_{i,j}\\textbf{z}^j\\Bigg)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn's LLE implementation has the following computational complexity: $O(m\\log(m)n\\log(k))$ for finding the $k$ nearest neighbors, $O(mnk^3)$ for optimizing the weights, and $O(dm^2)$ for constructing the low-dimensional representations. Unfortunately, the $m^2$ in the last term makes the algo scale poorly to very large datasets."
