# Intro to Machine Learning

This repo contains all of my notes/projects pertaining to my intro to Machine
Learning course that I did over the summer of 2018. The books used were [Python
Machine
Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka-ebook/dp/B00YSILNL0/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1536489146&sr=8-6&keywords=python+machine+learning)
as well as [Hands-On Machine
Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1536489146&sr=8-4&keywords=python+machine+learning).
There are notebooks that contain my notes and small projects.

Eventually, I'll add in markdown files containing my answers to the questions
at the end of each chapter.
